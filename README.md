# Teenage-Mental-Health-Analysis
Data analysis of teenage mental health using Python and Jupyter Notebook.


**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing teenage mental health patterns using anonymized behavioral data.  
It explores how factors like social media usage, sleep habits, exercise routines, and emotional support systems influence stress levels among teenagers.

The project demonstrates my skills in Python programming, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and professional project structuring using Jupyter Notebook.


** About the Dataset**

- Dataset Name: Teenage Mental Health
- Size: 1000 entries × 11 columns
- Format: Excel file (`Teenage Mental Health.xlsx`)
- Features Included:
  - `User_ID`: Unique anonymized ID
  - `Age`: Age of participant
  - `Gender`: Male/Female
  - `Social_Media_Hours`: Daily hours on social media
  - `Exercise_Hours`: Daily hours of physical activity
  - `Sleep_Hours`: Daily hours of sleep
  - `Screen_Time_Hours`: Total daily screen exposure
  - `Survey_Stress_Score`: Stress score from survey
  - `Wearable_Stress_Score`: Stress score from wearable devices
  - `Support_System`: Availability of emotional support (Yes/No)
  - `Academic_Performance`: Academic achievement level (High/Medium/Low)


 **Project Objectives **

- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize relationships between variables
- Identify factors most correlated with stress levels
- Derive meaningful insights for early mental health interventions
- Showcase Python, Jupyter, and GitHub project organization


** Skills & Tools Used **

- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Seaborn
  - Matplotlib
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

**Key Insights **
- Teenagers spending more than 5 hours daily on social media showed significantly higher stress levels.
- Higher sleep duration (7-9 hours) is associated with lower stress scores.
- Exercise emerged as a strong protective factor against stress — more active teenagers generally had lower stress.
- Presence of a support system (family/friends) is strongly linked with reduced stress.
- Excessive screen time correlated negatively with academic performance and positively with stress scores.


 **Project Structure **

Teenage-Mental-Health-Analysis/
Cleaned Teenage Mental Health.ipynb     Main Python analysis notebook
Teenage Mental Health.xlsx              Raw dataset
README.md                               Full project documentation
requirements.txt                        Python dependencies
.gitignore                              Files/folders to exclude from GitHub

**How to Run Locally **
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Teenage-Mental-Health-Analysis.git
cd Teenage-Mental-Health-Analysis
Install Required Libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook
Then open and run Cleaned Teenage Mental Health.ipynb.

**Why .gitignore is Included **
The .gitignore file ensures that unnecessary system files such as:

.ipynb_checkpoints/

__pycache__/

Temporary files (.log, .tmp)

Windows system files (Thumbs.db, desktop.ini)

...are not pushed to the GitHub repository.
This keeps the repository clean, professional, and focused only on the important project files, following industry best practices.

**Why requirements.txt is Included **
The requirements.txt file lists all the Python libraries required to run this project:
It helps recreate the same environment easily.
A recruiter or reviewer can install all dependencies in one command.
It shows good technical professionalism.

**Final Thoughts **
In an era where teenage mental health issues are increasingly prevalent,
this project highlights the value of data-driven approaches for early detection and intervention.
Through this analysis, I applied real-world data analysis skills, crafted compelling visualizations, and extracted meaningful insights — presenting it all in a clean, professional GitHub repository.
